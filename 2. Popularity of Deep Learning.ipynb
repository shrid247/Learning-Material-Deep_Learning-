    "Traditional Machine Learning approaches worked like the top half of the picture above. You would have to design a feature extraction algorithm which generally involved a lot of heavy mathematics, wasn't very efficient, and didn't perform too well at all (accuracy level just wasn't suitable for real-world applications). After doing all of that you would also have to design a whole classification model to classify your input given the extracted features."
