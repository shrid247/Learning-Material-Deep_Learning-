Developed by Facebook's AI research group and open-sourced on GitHub in 2017, it is used for natural language processing applications. PyTorch has a reputation for simplicity, ease of use, flexibility, efficient memory usage, and dynamic computational graphs. It also feels native, matking coding more manageable and increasing processing speed."

Nevertheless, we will still compare the two frameworks for the sake of completeness, especially since Keras users don't necessarily have to use TensorFlow."
